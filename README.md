## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run predeploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready to be deployed!

See [Create-React-App]https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment#github-pages) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Publishes the app to the configured Github Page at `https://myusername.github.io/my-app`
